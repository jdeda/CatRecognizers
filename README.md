### Welcome to CatRecognizers
Here you'll find a trio of machine learning models trained to label an image as true if it contains a cat. 
These models were inspired by Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course, which can found on [here.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

To use the model, please enter one of the global directories and run the script. You must pass an image file to the program for it do anything.
For example: `python cats_01.py < foo.png` will properly run the script!

#### Cat_Recognizer_01
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic logistic regression model.

#### Cat_Recognizer_02
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic deep neural network.

#### Cat_Recognizer_03
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Essentially CR-2 with LF regularization, mini-batching, and adam-optimizer.
