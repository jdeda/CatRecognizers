#### Welcome to CatRecognizers
Here you'll find a trio of machine learning models trained to label an image as true if it contains a cat. 
These models were inspired by Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course, which can found on [here.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

#### Cat_Recognizer_01
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic logistic regression model.

#### Cat_Recognizer_02
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic deep neural network.

#### Cat_Recognizer_03
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Essentially CR-2 with LF regularization, mini-batching, and adam-optimizer.
