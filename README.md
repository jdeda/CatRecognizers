Series of machine learning models trained to recognize cat or non cat images.

#### CR-1
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic logistic regression model.

#### CR-2
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Basic deep neural network.

#### CR-3
ANN built from scratch using NumPy. Essentially CR-2 with LF regularization, mini-batching, and adam-optimizer.
